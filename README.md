# Naive-GPU-Learning
Several naive implementations of machine learning algorithms with GPU(CUDA)

The first algorithm is Logistic Regression running on GPU with less than 200 lines code. 

Hardware: i7-6700K, Tesla M2050(1.03Tflops) 

Dataset: 1 million samples with 18 features 

Performance: 100 iterations in 6.6s
